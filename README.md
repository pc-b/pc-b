## About me

I am a 3rd year computer science student, with an interest in computer security. Also a newbie CTF player with a fascination for reverse engineering and binary exploitation .

### What I've been learning
Recently, I've dipped my toes into fields such as malware development and malware analysis to get a deeper understanding of how the windows operating system works and to write code on a level that directly interacts with the kernel. 
- Reading [practical malware analysis](https://www.amazon.ca/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901)
- Messing around with [HEVD](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver)

### Projects 
[Native API Shellcode Injector](https://github.com/pc-b/nativeapi-injector)
- A program that utilizes the Windows Native API to inject shellcode into another process.
- Uses the Native API instead of Win32 API to call the corresponding syscall for the task, bypassing a layer of abstraction included when using the Win32 API.

[Steam Group Search](https://github.com/pc-b/steamgroupSearch)
- A site that hosts a database of steam groups, where users can search the database by the name they are looking for.
- Scraped over 10,000,000 possible groups and provides searching of over 300,000 groups.


### Certifications
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
